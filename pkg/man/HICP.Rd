\title{Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (1990--2010, OECD)}

\description{
Time series data with HICP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices)
for 20 countries for 1990--2010 as provided by the OECD; and
corresponding seasonally adjusted inflation ratios.
}

\usage{
  data("HICP")

  data("hicps")  
}

\format{
Monthly multiple \code{"zooreg"} time series with \code{"yearmon"} index
from Jan 1990 to Dec 2010 for 21 countries.
}

\details{
\code{HICP} contains the raw unadjusted Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices
as provided by the OECD from which unadjusted inflation rates can be easily
computed (see examples).

As the different countries have rather different seasonal patterns which
vary over time (especially in the 2000s), they will typically require seasonal
adjustment before modeling. Hence, a seasonally adjusted version of the
inflation rate series is provided as \code{hicps}, where X-12-ARIMA (version 0.3)
has been employed for adjusted. An alternative seasonal adjustment can be easily
computed use \code{\link{stl}} (see examples).
